The law does not apply to student enrollment, so those who are self-funded would not be impacted. Exceptions to these restrictions, however, can be made with the approval from the state university Board of Governors, a 17-member organization that oversees the management of Florida’s public university institutions. The measure, State Bill 846, restricts the state’s public universities from hiring graduate students for positions such as researchers and lab assistants, from “countries of concern,” including China, the largest contributor of international students in the state.  … How about applicants who are currently living in another country but originated from the countries of concern?” Fang said that already, the faculty has been generally advised against considering candidates from those countries of concern because of the murkiness in the approval process.
