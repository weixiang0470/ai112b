>>> 請問什麼是強化學習
Reinforcement learning is an area of Machine Learning and differs from supervised learning in that it does not have the answer key in the training data. Instead, a reinforcement learning agent decides what to do to perform a given task. It is used to train models to make a sequence of decisions. One common example is a self-driving car, where the car must decide at each moment how to react to the road conditions to reach its destination safely. The learning process involves trial and error with occasional rewards for performing the desired action. The goal is to learn a series of actions that maximizes the reward over time.
